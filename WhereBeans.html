            A brand which has gained a great popularity with its coffee-brewing equipment all over the
            world has a rather short history dating back to 1921 when the company was founded under the name
            Hiromu Shibata Works. Back then, it was a heatproof glass manufacturer, and to this day, it
            remains the only Japanese manufacturer with a factory.
