            Buy local if you can. You are not only supporting your community but also the beans will 
            usually be a better quality. By buying local, these beans will mostly be freshly roasted 
            will will improve it's aroma, leading to a better coffee.
            </p>
        <p>Always buy whole beans. This is one of the most important things to remember. Pre-ground 
        beans may seem like a good idea but you are losing alot of flavour if you do so.
        </p>
        <p>Air is coffee's enemy. Once you open your brand new bag of beautiful coffee, make sure you 
        grind then brew as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>Check the roast date. Although old beans wont kill you, fresh beans will make you immortal so buy fresh.</p>
